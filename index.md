## Welcome to Alexa Developers Hub
This page will help you create and develop Alexa Skills and side-by-side also explain the various concepts of coding which you can apply in other development projects too.

### What should I know?
You should have a Amazon Developer account, if you don't have one [sign up](https://developer.amazon.com/) for it.

Excited?

Let's get started!

## Install the Alexa Skills Kit CLI (ASK CLI)

CLI stands for *Command Line Interface*, upon installation of which you can easily control your workflow using the command prompt without going to the Alexa Console.

As you must have known Alexa development can be done in both NodeJS and Python so download them to your system.  
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)(*download the one labelled as LTS*)  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)(*This link opens Python 3.6, the most stable and compatible version*)  

Once done, you can now begin to install the ASK CLI, open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Termial (Linux) and enter the following commands:
**Note if any of the commands dosen't run, then open the terminal / CMD as an administrator on Windows or type sudo before your commands in Linux.**

```npm install -g --production windows-build-tools@4.0.0  
   The above step is required only for windows  
   npm install -g ask-cli  
   ask configure  
```
After the above steps you'll be prompted to enter your credentials in your browser, enter them and you've succesfully completed the installation process!

Congrats!  

*Let's create a new Skill using the CLI.*

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tarunnsingh/alexa-webinars/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
